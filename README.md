## About
Within Hei.AI's website, users can monitor their wrists' angle measurements with animations, graphs, and instant feedback, all occurring in real-time. The Leap Motion Controller 1 records the user's wrist angle measurements and inputs those values into a dynamic graph representing the user's wrist movement over time. User data is defined as vector points for Wolfram Alpha AI and OpenAI to utilize. Wolfram Alpha AI computes the vector's magnitude of the user's hand movements to the optimal position for typing, which is the origin. OpenAI produces feedback as directional output for users to follow to adjust their typing position if needed.
